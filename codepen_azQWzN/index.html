  <b>The Basics of the Web and HTML</b><br>
  <br>
  During this stage of the nanodegree I learned a great deal about the parts that make up the web, as well as how to build the main type of document on the web. Here are the main takeaways from Stage 0.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Major Pieces of the Web</b><br>
  <br>
  -<b><em>http</em></b>: The main protocol of the web; used to communicate between you, servers, and browsers<br>
  -<b><em>Servers</em></b>: Computers that host the files that make up the web<br>
  -<b><em>Internet</em></b>: The world's largest computer network<br>
  -<b><em>Browser</em></b>: The program that runs on the computer to display files found on the web<br>
  <br>
  <b>HTML</b><br>
  <br>
  The main document found on the web, <b>HTML</b>, stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. HTML is made up of the following:<br>
  <br>
  -<b><em>Text Content</em></b>: What you see<br>
  -<b><em>Markup</em></b>: What it looks like<br>
  -<b><em>References</em></b> to other documents (images, videos)<br>
  -<b><em>Links</em></b> to other pages<br>
  <br>
  <b>HTML Markup</b><br>
  <br>
  Made up of <em>tags</em>, <em>elements</em>, and <em>attributes</em>.<br>
  <br>
  -<b><em>Tag</em></b>: Represented by angled brackets; opening and closing tags; void tags<br>
  -<b><em>Element</em></b>: Everything within a set of opening and closing tags<br>
  -<b><em>Attribute</em></b>: A property of an HTML element<br>
  <br>
  <b>Tags and Elements</b><br>

  <p><em>Opening tags</em> come before the content, while <em>closing tags</em> go after the content.  Each set of opening tags, content, and closing tags make up an <em>element</em>.  There are also <em>void tags</em>, which do not require closing tags to make up an element. Below is a list of tags that were discussed in this lesson:<br>
  <br>
  <b><em>b</em></b>: Bold font<br>
  <b><em>em</em></b>: Italic font<br>
  <b><em>br</em></b>: Break; void tag; allows to type text on multiple lines (inline)<br>
  <b><em>p</em></b>: Paragraph; also allows to type text on multiple lines; requires closing tag (block)</p>

  <p>While the <b><em>br</em></b> and <b><em>p</em></b> tags perform similar functions (both make text appear on multiple lines), there are a couple differences that are noteworthy. Unlike the <b><em>p</em></b> tag, the <b><em>br</em></b> tag does not require a closing tag. This is known as a <em>void tag</em>. In addition, <b><em>br</em></b> is <em>inline</em>, while <b><em>p</em></b></b> is <em>block</em>. Think of block text as having an imaginary box around it. This results in an extra space that a single <b><em>br</em></b> tag does not contain.</p>

  <b>Attributes</b>

  <p>Attributes are properties of HTML elements. These allow for content such as links, images, and videos to show up on a webpage. Here are some examples:</p>

  <p><b><em>anchor</em></b>: represented as the letter <em>a</em><br>
  <b><em>image</em></b>: represented as <em>img</em>; void tag</p>

  <p>Attributes require an <em>attribute name</em>, a <em>value</em>, and text to show what the attribute will look like to the internet user.</p>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  I now have an understanding of how the web and coding works. I learned that programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands and that it is difficult to remember everything. Don't be shy to ask your best <a href="http://www.google.com">friend</a> or your cohort if you need help.
